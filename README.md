# CE4317 - Introduction to Data Engineering and Machine Learning

I followed this module during my Erasmus semester (Sep 2024 - Dec 2024) at the University of Limerick.

# Module Aims/Objectives

The aim of the module is to give students an insight and grounding into information/data engineering and machine learning. The module will cover mathematical and coding skills essential to developing machine learning applications in Python and will provide an introduction to some advanced machine learning topics such as modern machine learning platforms, data visualisation, and deep learning.
